   - summary: "Restructured the network.base collection by converting supported operations into separate roles."
     details: |
       The following changes were made to the `network.base` collection:
       - Converted operations like `persist`, `detect`, `remediate`, `deploy`, and `configure` into individual roles for better modularity and clarity.
       - Each role (`persist`, `detect`, `remediate`, `deploy`, `configure`, `list`, `gather`) now has its own README.md and integration tests.
       - Updated all integration tests to align with the new role-based structure.
       - Improved documentation and usage examples for each role to reflect the restructuring.

     impact: 
       - "Developers need to update their playbooks to use roles instead of operations."
       - "Test cases and pipelines relying on operations must be updated to reference the new roles."

       - persist: "Now an independent role for saving network facts to local or remote data stores."
       - detect: "Now an independent role for identifying configuration drifts."
       - remediate: "Now an independent role for fixing configuration drifts by applying saved configurations."
       - deploy: "Now an independent role for deploying configurations based on inventory host_vars."
       - configure: "Now an independent role for applying configurations in a structured manner."
       - list: "New role to retrieve supported network resource modules."
       - gather: "New role to collect and display structured facts for network resources."
