## Network Base Validated Content
[![CI](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.base/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?event=schedule)](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.base/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7659/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7659)

This repository contains the `network.base` Ansible Collection.

## Description
The `network.base` application acts as a core for other validated content, as it provides the platform-agnostic role called Resource Manager.
This validated content provides a single platform-agnostic entry point to manage all the resources supported for a given network OS.

## Tested with Ansible

Tested with ansible-core 2.14 releases.

## Installation
#### Install from Automation Hub

To consume this Validated Content from Automation Hub, the following needs to be added to `ansible.cfg`:

```
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=<SuperSecretToken>
```
Get the required token from the [Automation Hub Web UI](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token).

With this configured, simply run the following commands:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install network.base
```

**Capabilities**
- Build Brownfield Inventory: `persist` operation enables users to fetch facts for provided resources and persist these
  YAML formatted structured host-vars either to local or remote data store which could act as a single SOT.
- Configuration Deployment: `deploy` operation enables a user to read the host_vars from a local or remote data store and deploys if any changes are found.
- Display Structured Configuration: `gather` operation enables users to be able to gather and display the structured facts for provided network resources.
- Configuration Drift: `detect` operation will read the facts from the default/local or remote inventory host_vars and detect if any
  configuration changes are there between running and provided config configuration.
- Remediate Configuration: The `remediate` operation will read the facts from the provided/default or remote inventory and remediate if there are any configuration changes on the appliances.
  This is done by overriding the running configuration with read facts from the provided inventory host vars.
- Supported Resource Modules Query: `list` operation enables users to get the list of supported resource modules for provided network os.
- Configure: `configure` is able to apply configuration in a normalized manner the way resource modules do.

### Usage
This platform-agnostic role enables the user to create a runtime brownfield inventory with all the configurations in terms of host vars.
These host vars are ansible facts that have been gathered through the network resource module. The tasks offered by this role could be observed below:

## Build Brownfield Inventory

#### fetch resource facts and build local inventory host_vars.
```yaml
run.yml
---
- hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:
  - name: Network Resource Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.base.resource_manager
    vars:
      operation: persist
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      resources:
        - 'interfaces'
        - 'l2_interfaces'
        - 'l3_interfaces'
        - 'bgp_global'
        - 'bgp_address_family'
        - 'ospfv2'
        - 'ospf_interfaces'
        - 'ospfv3
      data_store:
        local: "~/backup/network"
```

#### fetch all network resource facts and publish inventory host_vars to a remote repository.
```yaml
run.yml
---
- hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:
  - name: Network Resource Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.base.resource_manager
    vars:
      operation: persist
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      data_store:
        scm:
          parent_directory: "/home/rhel"
          origin:
            url: https://github.com/rohitthakur2590/network_validated_content_automation.git
            token: "{{ GH_PAT }}"
            user:
              name: ansiblegithub
              email: ansible@ansible.com
```

## Configuration Deployment
#### Read all host_vars from persisted local inventory and deploy changes to running-config.
```yaml
run.yml
---
- hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:
  - name: Network Resource Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.base.resource_manager
    vars:
      operation: deploy
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      resources:
        - 'interfaces'
        - 'l2_interfaces'
      data_store:
        local: "~/backup/network"
```

#### Read provided resources host vars from a remote repository and deploy changes to running-config.
```yaml
run.yml
---
- hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:
  - name: Network Resource Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.base.resource_manager
    vars:
      operation: deploy
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      resources:
        - 'interfaces'
        - 'l2_interfaces'
      data_store:
        scm:
          parent_directory: "/home/rhel"
          origin:
            url: https://github.com/rohitthakur2590/network_validated_content_automation.git
            token: "{{ GH_PAT }}"
